# GrocerEase Sprint Plans and Reports

### Preface

Updates to sprint plans were made directly on these documents. All sprint plans and reports reflect the most up to date information.

We used Trello for Scrum Boards and Burnup Charts. The Scrum boards in this document reflect that of the end of each sprint. Unforunately our Trello trial expired and we lost our Burnup charts, so they have been recreated based on task completion in Google Sheets.

Our scrum times for all sprints included all weeknights when multiple members were able to meet, as well as our TA meeting which usually took place Monday or Wednesday afternoon with Roberto Campbell.
